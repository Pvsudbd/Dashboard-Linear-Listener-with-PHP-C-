To run the code, all you need to do is preparing a client server (Xamp or Laragon), i prefer laragon!.

1. Run the contoh.exe to send the data to the frontend, aka the php listener.
   (.\contoh)
2. Make sure either your laragon or xamp is running!.
3. type localhost/uas/index.php on your browser.
   uas is the name of this project folder, all you need is to run the index file.
4. If what you type isn't showing up, configure your laragon ip to be the same as default ip (127.0.0.1) or you can just look it up on internet.
